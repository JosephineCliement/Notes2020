1)  C Programming History

2) Write a c program to find as follows :
     a) a=30 ,b =20 find a/b,   where a and b are float
     b) Program to find the area of circle and rectangle.
     
     #include<stdio.h>   //preprocessor statement
#include<conio.h>


int main()         // main function definition
   // 2
   
	 float pi,radius,area;
	 pi=3.14;
	 radius=4.1;
	 area=pi*radius;
	 printf("Area of circle : %f",area);
	 
	 float length=100,breadth=20;
	 float rect_area;
	
	rect_area=length*breadth;
	printf("\nArea of Rectangle : %f",rect_area)


	

     
     c) Program to print your name with your age.
     
     
     #include<stdio.h>   //preprocessor statement
#include<conio.h>


int main()         // main function definition
{
    printf("\nJose 20");
    
    return 0;
    
}
    


3) Write a program to calculate the following :
      a= 3.5
      b=2.5
    1)  a2+b2+2ab   
    3)  a2 /b2  
    
4) Write a program to define an integer ,character ,float and double values and print all values along with its size





5) Create a program to take 2 values from user and print addition, multiplication ,subtraction and division.


#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

main()
{

	
	int a =20;
	int b =10;
	int c;
	
	printf("\ndivision of %d and %d is %d",a,b,(a/b));
	printf("\naddition of %d and %d is %d",a,b,(a+b));
	printf("\nsubtraction of %d and %d is %d",a,b,(a-b));
	printf("\nmultiplication of %d and %d is %d",a,b,(a*b));
	
	
	return 0;
	
}




6) Take two numbers from user and compare values and print results as false or true.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

main()
{

	
	int x =30;
	int y=40;
	
	
	printf("%d\n",(x<y));
	printf("%d\n",(x>y));
	printf("%d\n",(x<=y));
	printf("%d\n",(x>=y));
	printf("%d\n",(x==y));
	printf("%d\n",(x!=y));
	
	
	return 0;
	
}



7) Create two variables , one is integer and other is double and do the operations like multiplication and subtraction on these variable.

8) Write a program to define a function Calculator() which accepts two integer values and print sum,subtraction,division and multiplication.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

void calculator(int a,int b);

int main()
{
	calculator(20,30);
	return 0;
	
}

void calculator(int a,int b)
{
	printf("\ndivision :%d",(a/b));
	printf("\nmultiplication :%d",(a*b));
	printf("\nsubtraction :%d",(a-b));
	
	
}





9) Write a program to define a function which takes a number from user and print the number.

10) Write a program to take a number from user and pass this number to the function named as Square() which returns the square of the number and print square value in main.

11) Write a function which takes a character in small case and returns the same character in capital case.

12) Write a program to display the result acoording to following using only if:
     
       marks < 40        Fail
       40 <= marks <65   Second Division
       65 <= marks < 75  First Division
       75 <= marks       Distinction
       
13) Write a program to find the largest of two numbers given by user.
